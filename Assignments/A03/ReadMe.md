### Class
* An abstract object type that is a collection of various data types. Individual representatives within the class are refered to as *instances* of a class.
### Object
### Method
### Abstraction
* A problem solving technique where details are grouped up into a single concept. Thus this concept can be seen as a single object rather than multiple, with nonessential information being ignored.
### Encapsulation
### Polymorphism
* Classically, it means many forms. In Computer Science, it's meaning changes depending on who you ask. In Object-Oriented Programming, It refers to the ability of having one name (be it variable, function, etc.) taking on many different purposes. There are at least 4 different types of polymorphism; Overloading, Overriding, Polymorphic Variable, and Generics.
### Overloading
* Also known as ad hoc polymorphism, Overlaoding describes situations where one function name has several different implementations depending on how that named function is called.
* For example, void Push (int x) and void Push (string name) has the same name, but calls a different function based on what data has been passed through.
### Attributes / Properties
### Class Variable
* A variable that is shared by all instances within that class. In C++, it is a data type that is declared as *static*.
### Instance Variable
### Member Variable
### Inheritance
### Multiple Inheritance
### Composition
