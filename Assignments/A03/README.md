### Class
* An abstract object type that is a collection of various data types. Individual representatives within the class are refered to as *instances* of a class.
### Object
* A keyword that is used for indicating the definition of a particular object type.
### Method
* A function that is found within a class / object type. It works in a message-passing style.
### Abstraction
* A problem solving technique where details are grouped up into a single concept. Thus this concept can be seen as a single object rather than multiple, with nonessential information being ignored.
### Encapsulation
* A method of hiding information away in a structure. Comparable to hiding instance data within a class.
### Polymorphism
* Classically, it means many forms. In Computer Science, it's meaning changes depending on who you ask. In Object-Oriented Programming, It refers to the ability of having one name (be it variable, function, etc.) taking on many different purposes. There are at least 4 different types of polymorphism; Overloading, Overriding, Polymorphic Variable, and Generics.
### Overloading
* Also known as ad hoc polymorphism, Overlaoding describes situations where one function name has several different implementations depending on how that named function is called.
* For example, void Push (int x) and void Push (string name) has the same name, but calls a different function based on what data has been passed through.
### Attributes / Properties
* The exact definition seems to vary based on context.
1. A property can be changed syntactically in  a mannewr like a data field, yet operates internally, much like a method. It can be read as either an expression or as a value assignment.
1.  Properties seems to also refer to the various methods used within a class.
### Class Variable
* A variable that is shared by all instances within that class. In C++, it is a data type that is declared as *static*.
### Instance Variable
* Maintained by an instance, this represents the state of an object.
### Member Variable
* A variable that is associated with specific objects. As such, they are accessable to all the associated objects.
### Inheritance
* The property of objects where a class has an instance of having acces to data and method information. This information is found in a preciously defined class, and as such, does not to be restated again in order to be used. 
### Multiple Inheritance
* This allows for a subclass to inherit information from more than one immediate superclass. However, this is not supported by all object-oriented languages. 
### Composition
* An alternative to inheritance, this method treats user-defined object types as if they are a newly defined object.
